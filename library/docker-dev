# "latest" intentionally missing, since "docker-dev:latest" implies (IMO) the "latest development image", which these builds never will be
# if that is what you are after, see "dockercore/docker" (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/dockercore/docker/)

# "supported": one tag per major, only upstream-supported majors (which is currently only "latest")
